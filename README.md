# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Author: Wellington Aquino

### Project Description

This is a **React-based web application** designed with a responsive layout and interactive components using **React** and **SCSS**. The application features a dynamic layout with a series of cards, which adjust to different screen sizes. The layout includes various effects such as hover changes, disabled buttons, and text wrapping for dynamic content within the cards. It is aimed at displaying "Firm Facts" in an interactive and user-friendly manner, with a focus on responsiveness for different screen sizes.

### Features:
- Responsive layout that adapts to screen sizes from 768px to 1680px.
- Two variants of cards with different hover and border effects.
- Interactive buttons with disabled states and text wrapping.
- Clean and modern user interface.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `node_modules`
The `node_modules` directory should always be excluded from GitHub. It was left in this particular case because the requirement says it should only call `yarn start`.
