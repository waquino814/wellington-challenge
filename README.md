## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### node_modules
node_modules should allways be excluded from github, they were left in this particular case becasue the requirement says it should only call yarn start
